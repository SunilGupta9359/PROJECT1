# PROJECT1
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
* Here I will write a Hive program for analyzing weather datasets to understand its data processing programming model. 
* Weather sensors are collecting weather information across the globe in a large volume of log data. 
* This weather data is semi-structured and record-oriented.
* This data is stored in a line-oriented ASCII format, where each row represents a single record. 
* Each row has lots of fields like longitude, latitude, daily max-min temperature, daily average temperature, etc. for easiness, we will focus on the main element, i.e. temperature.
* We will use the data from the National Centres for Environmental Information(NCEI). It has a massive amount of historical weather data that we can use for our data analysis.

## INSIGHTS NEEDED
* To see dataset of weather
* Total number of record in the dataset
* Finding maximum temperature
* Finding minimum temperature
* Counting Total number of countries from dataset
* Country with Maximum longitude
* country with temp>=50 and temp<=60
* To get the count of states in countries where fog=‘1’
