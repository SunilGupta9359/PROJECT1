Here, I have written a Hive program for analyzing weather datasets to understand its data processing programming model. 
Weather sensors are collecting weather information across the globe in a large volume of log data. 
This weather data is semi-structured and record-oriented.
This data is stored in a line-oriented ASCII format, where each row represents a single record. 
Each row has lots of fields like longitude, latitude, daily max-min temperature, daily average temperature, etc.
for easiness, I will focus on the main element, i.e. temperature. I will use the data from the National Centres for Environmental Information(NCEI).
It has a massive amount of historical weather data that we can use for our data analysis.
